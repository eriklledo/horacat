**Horacat: Android App to Display Catalan Time**

**Description:**
Horacat is a simple Android app that displays the current time in Catalan. This app is primarily intended for people to check the time in Catalan. I created it because traditional Catalan time is complex, and as a result, most people don't say it correctly. I hope that in this way I can help to preserve the language.

**Features:**
Displays the current time in Catalan, with a complete format that includes the hour, the quarters or minutes, and the time of day (dawn, morning, noon, afternoon, evening, and night).
Widget: You can add a widget to the home screen to see the current time in Catalan without having to open the app.

**Installation:**
In the future, the Horacat app will be available in the F-Droid app store.

For now, you can download the APK file manually:
· Open a web browser on your Android device.
· Go to https://github.com/sonwerik/horacat/blob/main/app/release/horacat.apk.
· Download the file horacat.apk.
· Open the File Manager app on your Android device.
· Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the APK file.
· Tap the horacat.apk file.
· Select "Install".
· Once the app is installed, you can open it and start using it.

**Source Code:**
The app's source code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/sonwerik/horacat
